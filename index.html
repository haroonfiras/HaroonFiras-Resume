        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">To whom it may concern, my name is Haroon Firas and I am a 2nd year Bachelor of Science Psychology student at the University of California Riverside. As a goal oriented person, I strive to better myself every day to reach for the skies. I plan on starting research labs next quarter with a focus on behavioral development and continuing until I am an accomplished therapist. As of now, I have no prior lab experience other than an understanding of basic safety procedures. During the past 8 months, I have worked part-time as a process server which has taught me many applicable skills. For one of the most important being patience. In todayâ€™s society, I have come to realize that only a select few individuals are capable of keeping a cool head when receiving unfortunate news via legal documents. For this reason, I have developed a great tolerance for verbal slander and hateful words. My extreme patience is significantly important for my future occupation as I am well aware that I will encounter severely mentally ill clients that may lash out. It would be my job to aid them by addressing their issues. Within my household, I also learned a variety of handyman skills ranging from plumbing to electrical tasks. The occasional house issues popped up and I saw them as learning opportunities. This mentality is important in many fields of work because not everything in life goes as planned. I do not dwell in failure, but instead attempt to learn from my mistakes in order to better myself the next time I am faced with similar challenges.<br><br>

        Other values I find to be important are honesty, loyalty, perseverance, and accountability. Honesty is vital for effective communication and building interpersonal relationships within a working atmosphere. I believe that I would work better with the trust of my coworkers, having full faith in their capabilities. Loyal individuals are difficult to find but pivotal for consistency. The labor force is hard to get into, but easy to get out of and loyal workers are indispensable in comparison to those who bounce from job to job. I will remain loyal with those I respect. Perseverance is a great trait that I struggle to maintain, but during hard times, I always rise up keeping my head out of the gutter. I am well-aware of the struggles we all inevitably face, but the strongest come out stronger. Lastly, I am a very accountable person. I have no shame in admitting my faults, and discipline myself in order to expect better results the next time. I stick to my words and will happily be called out otherwise. These are some of my foundational values that I test myself with every day as a means of personal development. <br><br>

        My background consists of a Caucasian and Palestinian mix. This duality is significant to me because I was given two lenses from which I can perceive the world. The good and bad. As an Arab-American, I believe my identity played an important role in developing my personality and way of life. I live a clean life, completely sober and limitless of thoughts. This factor about me is relevant to how I carry myself around everyone my age because it is fairly uncommon, but it is not a limiting factor. In fact, it helps filter the people whom I surround myself with effectively.
